We performed a series of simulations only varying the effective arc thickness as it controls the buoyancy of intra\u2010oceanic arcs.

In simulations with less buoyant arcs (15\u201331\u00a0km; effective thickness), we observe arc\u2010transference to the overriding plate and slab\u2010anchoring and folding at the 660\u00a0km transition zone that result in fluctuations in the slab dip, strain\u2010stress regime, surface kinematics, and viscous dissipation.

Conversely, simulations with more buoyant arcs (32\u201335\u00a0km; effective thickness) do not lead to arc\u2010transference and result in slab break\u2010off, which causes an asymptotic trend in surface kinematics, viscous dissipation and strain\u2010stress regime, and lithospheric extension in the overriding plate.
